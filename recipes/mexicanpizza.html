    <h2>How to make mexican pizza</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Tortillas</li>
        <li>Refried Beans</li>
        <li>Ground Beef</li>
        <li>Taco seasoing</li>
        <li>Enchilada Sauce</li>
        <li>Colby Jack Cheese</li>
        <li>Diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The first step is to make the taco meat. You can use ground beef or ground turkey and whatever taco
            seasoning you like. Just make it like you would for taco night.
        </li>
        <li>Next you want to get the tortillas nice and crispy. If you have a griddle or large skillet that fits more
            than one, break it out for this. Add a little bit of oil to your pan and heat the tortillas over a medium
            high heat. You want to flip them frequently so they don’t burn. But cook for 4-5 minutes until they are
            crispy.
        </li>
        <li>Now you start assembling. Spread a layer of refried beans along the bottom of the tortilla. Top with a layer
            of taco meat.
        </li>
        <li>Once you have your filling, add the second tortilla and top with enchilada sauce. You don’t want too much,
            or it will get soggy.
        </li>
        <li>Add a few diced tomatoes and an even layer of cheese over the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>Now you bake until the cheese is melted, the tortillas are crispy and everything is hot!
        </li>
        <li>I like to let them sit for a minute before I slice them so it doesn’t make a huge mess. Serve with salsa,
            sour cream, guacamole, or just as is!
        </li>
    </ol>
