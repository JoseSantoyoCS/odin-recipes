    <h2>How to make a vietnamese eggroll</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground pork</li>
        <li>Ground turkey</li>
        <li>Shredded cabbage</li>
        <li>Yellow Onion</li>
        <li>Bean Threads/Cellophane Noodels</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Fish sauce</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Cornstarch</li>
        <li>Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>Egss</li>
        <li>Spring Roll wrappers</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by soaking the bean threads in water to soften them. Usually the package comes with 3 bundles of
            noodles,
            you want to use 2 of them for this recipe. Add to a bowl and pour boiling water over them.
            Let them stand for 20-30 minutes until they are soft. Drain and cut into 1 inch pieces.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, using a stand mixer, mix together pork and ground turkey until the it is well combined.</li>
        <li>Add sugar, cornstarch, garlic powder, and black pepper and mix until everything is well blended.</li>
        <li>Next mix in the eggs and fish sauce and mix until everything is fully incorporated.</li>
        <li>Transfer the meat mixture to a very large mixing bowl and use your hands to mix in the carrots, cabbage,
            onion, and been threads until evenly blended.
        </li>
        <li>Pour oil into a heavy bottom pot and heat to 350ยบ F.</li>
        <li>Next add about 3 oz of filling into the bottom half of a wrapper.</li>
        <li>Roll it from the bottom up and tuck the point underneath the filling and roll half way, shaping it into a
            round
            log.</li>
        <li>Next fold each end over to close. Lightly brush the exposed edge of the wrapper with the egg mixture and
            complete wrapping the egg roll. Be careful to no wrap it too tightly as it will explode while frying.
        </li>
        <li>Gently place egg rolls into hot oil, being careful not to overcrowd the pot. I usually cook 4-5 at one time.
            Cook for 4-5 minutes until they are golden brown. You can check the internal temperature to know when they
            are safe to remove. I like to remove when the temperature reads 150ยบ F. They will continue to cook as they
            cool and reach 165ยบ in just a couple of minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from the oil and place on a wire rack to drain. Let the rest for about 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
